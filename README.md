# [SpeedJots.com](https://speedjots.com)

An open source Ember SAAS project for taking notes called SpeedJots.

It's simple, easy, and single minded: jots only.

See it in action and give it a whirl at [SpeedJots.com](https://speedjots.com).

Please raise issues and submit feature requests by opening an issue at the link at the top. Keep in mind that the point is to keep features to the bare necessities.

Pull requests are of course welcome!

## What's next for SpeedJots?

Any help with the following is greatly appreciated:

1. Add more login options: FB and Github (and possibly email).

1. Add option to print: open a new webpage with only the Jot's title, tags, and content so user can print from there.  (Or maybe employ: [printjs](http://printjs.crabbly.com/))

1. Add option to download all or a single Jot as a text file. Not sure how to go about this, but [ember-cli-file-saver](https://github.com/cogniteev/ember-cli-file-saver) might help.

1. Enable mobile drag and drop. [ios-html5-drag-drop-shim](https://github.com/timruffles/ios-html5-drag-drop-shim) might be helpful.

1. Add markdown support to the editor? [simditor-markdown](https://github.com/mycolorway/simditor-markdown)

1. Add link to this Github repo on the app somewhere.

1. Setup a demo site for users to try before logging in for the first time.

1. Refactor code.
