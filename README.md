# [SpeedJots.com](https://speedjots.com)

An open source Ember SAAS project for taking notes called SpeedJots: simple, easy, and single minded - jots only.

Give it a whirl at [SpeedJots.com](https://speedjots.com).

Ask questions, raise issues, and submit feature requests by opening an issue. Keep in mind that the point is to keep features to the bare necessities.

Pull requests are of course welcome!

## What's next for SpeedJots?

Any help with the following is greatly appreciated:

1. Add option for use to delete their account.

1. Change print to employ: [printjs](http://printjs.crabbly.com/) or is it fine the way it is?

1. Add option to download all or a single Jot as a text file. Not sure how to go about this, but [ember-cli-file-saver](https://github.com/cogniteev/ember-cli-file-saver) might help.

1. Enable mobile drag and drop. [ios-html5-drag-drop-shim](https://github.com/timruffles/ios-html5-drag-drop-shim) might be helpful.

1. Add markdown support to the editor? [simditor-markdown](https://github.com/mycolorway/simditor-markdown)

1. Setup a demo site for users to try before logging in for the first time.  Possibly use the anonymous login option in Firebase?

1. Refactor code: move login component to it's own route.

      authDomain: "[your info here]",
      databaseURL: "[your info here]",
      storageBucket: "[your info here]",

   },
   ```
